# abpm50ex
ABPM50 file reader and exporter


This is a small tool created to read the .awp files created by Contec ABPM50 blood pressure recorder and convert into a Excel file.
You still need to use the proprietary software to get the .awp files off the device. You can then use this to extract all data into a xlsx file (for use in excel etc.)

The tool works for up to 999 data entries in a file.

Usage:
Feel free to run the python script dierectly
However, an exe file has been uploaded for anyone less technical who wants their ABPM50 data in excel format. Simply download the exe file in from the bin folder and run it.
