# abpm50ex
ABPM50 file reader and exporter


This is a small tool created to read the .awp files created by ABPM50 blood pressure recorder and convert into a CSV file.
You still need to use the proprietary software to get the .awp files off the device but you can then use this to extract all data into a CSV file (for use in excel etc.)
